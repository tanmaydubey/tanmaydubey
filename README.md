# 👋 Hi, I’m Tanmay Dubey

I'm a software engineer focused on machine learning infrastructure, distributed systems, and interpretable AI. Over the past 5+ years, I’ve built production-grade systems across QA automation (Infosys), SDN control/data planes (AWS EC2), and ML model serving backends (Lyft).

My academic background blends mathematics, symbolic modeling, and unsupervised learning. In undergrad, I built a classifier to generate research subfields using LDA and clustering; earlier, I applied group theory and Pólya’s Enumeration Theorem to analyze symmetry in twelve-tone music.

I'm especially interested in:
- Bridging symbolic reasoning and neural networks
- Building systems that are interpretable, fair, and efficient
- Research that connects math, meaning, and machine learning

🧠 **Highlighted projects**:
- [`topic-modeling-cs-papers`](https://github.com/tanmaydubey/topic-modeling-cs-papers): Unsupervised subfield classification using topic modeling and clustering
- *(More coming soon)*
